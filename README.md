A simple project while learning Rust - a solution to the n-queens problem.

## Getting Started

This project exists to help me get started with `Rust`. It's not meant to be a *good* illustration of the n-queens problem per se, so please move along if you're looking for a serious implementation of the algorithm.

## Prerequisites

- [Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Building

If you've got Rust installed and the repo cloned, all you need to do is build and run. Here's how:

```bash
cd <path-to-repo>
cargo build             # Build the project
cargo run --release     # Run it
```

If it worked, you'll also find a binary in the `target/release` directory that you can run directly. Good luck!

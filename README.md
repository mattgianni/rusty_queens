A simple project while learning Rust - a solution to the n-queens problem.

## Getting Started

This project exists to help me get started with `Rust`. It's not meant to be a *good* illustration of the n-queens problem per se, so please move along if you're looking for a serious implementation of the algorithm.

If on the other hand you have a good sense of humor and you're looking for a simple project to help you get started with Rust, which includes basic argument parsing, logging, error handling, and unit testing, all written by rank amateurs ... then **this might be the project for you!**

## Prerequisites

- [Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Building

If you've got Rust installed and the repo cloned, all you need to do is build and run. Here's how:

```bash
cd <path-to-repo>
cargo build             # Build the project
cargo run --release     # Run it
```

If it worked, you'll also find a binary in the `target/release` directory that you can run directly. Good luck!

## Contributing

Feeling unsure of yourself in `Rust` ... or just plain bored? Then this is the project for you! The bar is **really** low. If you think you can improve this thing or at least not break it completely, please feel free to contribute by submitting a pull request. I'll be sure to take a look at it ... eventually.
